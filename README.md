### How to make the exercises work : 
``` git clone "git@github.com:olelong/42_container.git" ```

``` cd my_repo_git_name ```

Run the ``` make ``` command to run only my ft_container.

Then launch the executable ``` ./ft_containers ```.  

##### OR

Run the ``` make real ``` command to run only the stl container.

Then launch the executable ``` ./real ```.  

##### OR

Run the ``` make test ``` command to run both and see the difference beteween them.
It is normal that the max size is different between the one of my container and the one of the stl.

``` SRCS_DIR	= mains/mine/ ```

``` SRCS		= main_map.cpp ```
